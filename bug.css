This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with classes that have conflicting styles. For example, if you have two classes, one with `text-red-500` and another with `text-blue-500`, and you apply both using `@apply`, the order in which these classes are defined will determine the resulting color. The last class applied will override the previous one. This can lead to unexpected styling if the order is not carefully considered.
